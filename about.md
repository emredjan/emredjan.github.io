I am Emre, a part-time [MBA Big Data & Business Analytics](http://mbabigdata.nl) student at UvA and a full-time business intelligence specialist.
I decided to start this blog as I believe it's the best way to share my journey as I learn and try to become a better data scientist.

In the spring of 2016, I realized my passion and my career lies in data & analytics and I needed to take a step further. 
I hope you will also find some insights and have fun reading about it.

I'll write about my personal experiences, interesting analyses and developments in the field.
You'll occasionally find programming / scripting examples in R, Python, SQL or maybe C# (as I try to get better)

You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/emrecan) page for detailed qualifications, 
my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/emredjan/)
and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emredjan).
