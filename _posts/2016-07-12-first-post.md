Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. This design is fucking brilliant. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Don’t fucking lie to yourself. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough.

Learn from fucking criticism. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old.
