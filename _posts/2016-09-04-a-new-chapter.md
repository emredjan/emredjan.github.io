It's the opening week! My MBA starts on Tuesday with some refresher courses on databases / SQL and statistics / econometrics. 
I'm scared but really excited to be studying again. It will be a tough two years that's for sure, with my work and evening classes,
but hopefully I'll manage.

Meanwhile I'll try to get busy with the new [Kaggle dataset on house prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
I'll be sure to share my findings / insights here. Until then, happy school year to you all :)
