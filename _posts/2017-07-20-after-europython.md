It's over. For 2017 that is. One magical week in Rimini came to an end with the closing talks of [EuroPython 2017](https://ep2017.europython.eu/en) conference. This was my first truly technical no-nonsense conference, and I appreciated the change of scenery after all the business-enterprise conferences with all the buzzwords and PRs disguised as talks. You can be sure I'll be coming back for 2018, but I'll also try to attend other ones like [PyData](#TODO), [PyCon](#TODO), and others.

### The Good

- Unpretentious, welcoming people / People that you have in common
- Different tracks / talks for everything
- Real informative and educative content, less PR
- Non-technical content that's important for technical people
- The beach, the food, the weather
- Social event, general socializing opportunities
- Sprints
- Conference goodies

### The Bad

- Diversity / Small number of women and minorities, both in speakers and the visitors
- Wifi :)
- The heat!
- Speaker with limited public speaking skill (though, that's how they'll improve)

### The Takeaway

- Public speaking, important
- Open Source contribution, don't be afraid
- Overcome your biases, ignore subconcious patterns, and reduce your models' biases
